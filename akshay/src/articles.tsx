                <p>It was a scary night. God of CSS had set the <i>background-color</i> to <i>‘grey’</i> and <i>‘display: none’</i> to most things. The clock had started yawning A…M. And in such a dark and void night, Flexbox was walking home, alone and hurriedly, after a long hectic day of aligning items and justifying content. He was scared. He had heard a lot of rumours about this area and this street in particular, although he never believed them.</p>

                <p>  Flexbox believed in science. He knew that the world is governed by the laws of <i>box-model</i>. Most people around him believed that these laws of box-model were set by some divine God called Jesus Webdev but Flexbox was a bitter follower of atheism. He believed that life has no purpose or any meaning. <i>‘Shrink-grow-wrap-repeat’</i>, that’s the only life he knew.</p>

                A man walking home at night.

                <p>
                    That scarry night…
                    Flexbox always despised the concept of ghosts and people believing in ghosts. But as the background-color started getting darker and more things went to display: none, Flexbox started doubting his beliefs.
                </p>

                <p>  Nights like these are not the best time to ponder over the existence of ghosts, but Flexbox had seen many of his atheist friends turning to God in such situations. He tried distracting himself by thinking about something else.</p>

                <p>
                    Flexbox had a measurable past. In school, his classmates used to bully him for being so mild. His co-workers would call him a ‘beta’. However, Flexbox had no trouble finding women for dates (for obvious reasons) but Flexbox found it hard to make meaningful relationships. As soon as someone becomes close to him, he would start increasing margin and padding. In his office, there was a girl named Grid. He really liked her but the problem was she was obsessively tidy. She hated asymmetry. Flexbox on the other hand never gave much thought to such things. He knew himself very well. He would rather be part of the mess rather than fixing the mess. So their relationship never went further than friendship. Later Flexbox came to know that Grid actually was in relation with some guy named Table. So Flexbox finally gave up on her.

                </p>
                <p>A bat flew right above him almost crashing into his head. Flexbox felt like his heart stopped for a moment. He looked around. It was totally black now. He wondered if his legs had some kind of memory. He had covered almost half of his way home in such darkness. He checked the clock. It was already past midnight. He hastened his walk. The silence was fueling the fear and his boots had assumed the role of an orator. Suddenly something came under his feet and he trembled. His hands struggled to find some support but couldn’t. Finally, his legs gave up and he fell to the ground.</p>

                <p>
                    As Flexbox hit the ground, he felt his carefully maintained structure collapse. For a moment, he lay there, sprawled across the dark street like a set of divs without proper alignment.

                </p>
                <p>
                    “Get a grip,” he muttered to himself, trying to flex his way back to his feet. But something was off. His usually flexible joints felt stiff, almost… blocked.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Suddenly, a deep, terrifying voice boomed from the darkness: “Well, well, well. If it isn’t Mr. Flexible himself, out for a midnight walk.”

                </p>
                <p>Flexbox froze. He knew that voice. It was the voice of his old foe, Block Elementiston.</p>

                <p> “B-Block?” Flexbox stuttered, trying to maintain his cool. “What are you doing here? I thought you were deprecated!”</p>

                <p> Block giggled, a sound that sent shivers down Flexbox’s spine. “Deprecated? Oh, you modern layouts think you’re so clever. But some of us… we never truly go away.” Block thought of himself as being like Javascript code after the 'return' - unreachable.</p>

                <p>
                    As Block stepped into view, Flexbox gasped. Block wasn’t alone. Behind him stood a motley crew of — Table, Float, and even the dreaded Inline-Block.

                </p>
                <p>  “What’s the matter, Flexbox?” Table Layout sneered. “Can’t handle this little structure?”</p>

                <p>
                    Flexbox tried to stand tall, but he felt his confidence wavering. “Look, guys, we don’t need to fight. There’s room for all of us in the CSS world. Can’t we just… coexist?”

                </p>
                <p>   Float laughed, a harsh sound that echoed through the dark street. “Coexist? You’ve been trying to push us out for years! It’s time we showed you what real layout power looks like!”</p>

                <p>
                    As the gang of old-school layouts closed in, Flexbox felt his resolve weakening. He closed his eyes, bracing for impact. But just as all hope seemed lost, a brilliant light pierced the darkness.

                </p>
                <p>“Stop right there!” a commanding voice rang out.</p>

                <p>
                    Flexbox’s eyes flew open. There, hovering above the street in all her grid-lined glory, was Grid.

                </p>
                <p>“G-Grid?” Flexbox gasped. Gird looked at Flexbox smiling and then turned to Table looking right into his eyes. Table could feel the rage in her eyes. He backed a bit.</p>

                <p> Flexbox muttered, “But I thought you were with Table?”</p>

                <p>Grid rolled her eyes. “Please. That was just a phase. Now, are we going to show these outdated layouts how it’s done, or what?”</p>

                <p>As Grid descended to stand beside him ready to face the gang of old layouts. Flexbox felt his strength returning. Block sneered, “Two against four? You don’t stand a chance!”</p>

                <p>Suddenly, a voice roared from above, “Make that three!” A figure in a flowing cape descended from the sky, landing dramatically between Flexbox and Grid.</p>

                <p> “CSS-Man!” they all gasped in unison.</p>

                <p> CSS-Man, the legendary superhero of web design, struck a pose. “I heard there was trouble in the layout neighbourhood. Looks like I arrived just in time for some property-based combat!”</p>

                <p> Block Element charged forward, but CSS-Man merely raised an eyebrow and declared, “Transform: rotate(180deg)!” Block spun around, dizzy and disoriented.</p>

                <p> Table Layout tried to trap them in a complex nested structure, but Grid simply laughed. “Please, I eat complex layouts for breakfast!” With a wave of her hand, she rearranged Table’s cells into a beautiful mosaic of a surprised Pikachu face.</p>

                <p> Float attempted to, well, float away, but Flexbox was too quick. “Oh no, you don’t! Align-items: center!” he shouted, plucking Float out of the air and holding him in place.</p>

                <p>
                    Inline-Block, realizing he was outmatched, tried to make himself scarce with a muttered “Display: none,” but CSS-Man caught him with a swift “!important”.

                </p>
                <p>As the dust settled, the gang of old layouts lay defeated and tangled in a mess of their own deprecated code.</p>

                <p>
                    “Well,” said CSS-Man, dusting off his cape, “looks like that’s wrapped up neater than a well-formatted stylesheet.”

                </p>
                <p> Grid turned to Flexbox, a glimmer in her eye. “You know, Flexbox, I think we make a pretty good team. How about we grab a coffee and discuss some layout strategies?”</p>

                <p>
                    Flexbox blushed, his containers expanding with joy. “I’d like that. But what about Table? I thought you two were in relation.”

                </p>
                <p>
                    Grid laughed. “Oh, that relationship was about as stable as Internet Explorer. Besides, I’ve always had a thing for flexible types.”

                </p>
                <p> As they walked off together, CSS-Man called after them, “Remember, kids: with great power comes great responsiveness!”</p>

                <p>
                    Just then, a groggy Block Element sat up, rubbing his head. “What happened? Did anyone get the license plate of that media query that hit me?”

                </p>
                <p> CSS-Man chuckled, helping Block to his feet. “Come on, old-timer. Let’s get you home. I think it’s time we had a talk about graceful degradation.”</p>

                <p>
                    And so, as the sun began to rise, turning the background-color from dark grey to a warm orange, our heroes walked off into the dawn of a new day in web design. The streets were once again safe for modern layouts, and somewhere, a web developer woke up, blissfully unaware of the epic battle that had ensured their stylesheet would render correctly.

                </p>
                <p>The end… or is it? After all, in the world of web design, there’s always another update just around the corner!</p>
